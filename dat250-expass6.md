**Short Report**

Had some Technical problems with getting the angular project up and running. Tried to do it directly from the terminal in Vscode, but
always got the error of "Error: This command is not available when running the Angular CLI outside a workspace".

Eventually installin and creating the angular project worked from powershell.

I did not manage to get most of the HTTP-requests to work, except the delete for some reason. The Todos in the image above are hard-coded in. The problem should not be that hard to solve, but i might be missing something crucial. I sadly have no time tomorrow to try to figure it out.
