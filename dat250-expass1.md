## Heroku Report

**Installation Problems and Validation**

I had no problems with the installations, but Mavan was the only tool i was missing. 
We have used Eclipse in several other courses so it works fine. I plan on using VScode which i have used before and should work fine.

**Technical Problems**
During the setup of the Heroku app i ran into problems with the ```mvn clean install``` command.
