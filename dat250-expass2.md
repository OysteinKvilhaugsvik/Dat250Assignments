**Short Report**

I encountered no technical problems during installation. But we had allready used JPA in another subject before.

To inspect the database table i set the generation-output-mode to "both". I am unsure if there is a way to also view the data in derby databases.

All the tests ran smoothly in the end. I had some problems with pushing the project to github from eclipse. I instead had to use github Desktop.
